        Bismillah, on this blessed day of your life...<br><br>

        💌 May Allah ﷻ fill your year with endless barakah, success, and moments that make your soul smile — with the blessings of Rasool-e-Paak ﷺ. Ameen. 🤲🏼<br><br>

        🌙 You’re not just my life partner—you’re a destined gift from Allah. A flawless piece of His perfect plan for me.
        I pray He protects us, guides us closer to Him, and writes only khair, barakah ✨, and the love of His Prophets, Ahlul Bayt, and Auliya Allah 📿 into our story.<br><br>

        I love the way you secretly keep staring at me when you think I'm not noticing — and then casually look away like you weren't doing anything. Your smile in those moments? That's my favourite view. 😊<br><br>

        Rumi once said, "Words are a pretext. It is the inner bond that draws one person to another, not words."
        And that's what I feel with you. Even in silence, something between us speaks — soft, sincere, and full of meaning.<br><br>

        🎉 Today, I pray Allah grants you:<br>
        🤍 Strength in iman<br>
        🌸 Joy in every step<br>
        💞 A love that grows firmer in His light<br><br>

        I want you to know—I’ll always be more than just your partner. I’ll be your closest friend, your biggest supporter, and someone who grows with you—rooted in love, respect, and shared faith.<br><br>

        Let's keep this journey sincere, meaningful, and full of the kind of love that feels like home — and a lot of forever smiles 😊<br><br>

        Happy Birthday, Farhana. You're my calm, my person, my joy.<br><br>
